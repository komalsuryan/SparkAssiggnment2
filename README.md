For this assignment you will use the training and testing datasets.( train.csv & test.csv)

You are to load the dataset using Spark and perform the operations below:

 

Exploratory Data Analysis- Follow up on the previous spark assignment 1 and explain a few statistics. (20 pts)

Feature Engineering - Create new attributes that may be derived from the existing attributes. This may include removing certain columns in the dataset. (30 pts)

Prediction - Use the train.csv to train a Machine Learning model of your choice & test it on the test.csv. You are required to predict if the records in test.csv survived or not. Note( 1 = Survived, 0 = Dead) (50 pts)

Please note: Do not include the test.csv while training the model. Also do not use the 'Survived' column during training. Doing these would defeat the purpose of the entire model.

 

The classifier must have an accuracy of 70 % for 100 pts.

The submission must be on a new github repository or databricks public notebook along with the Assignment pdf. Please provide Screenshots of the results in the Assignment.pdf for submission.
